We are at the component:
1. On update machine_id => what should be changed?
2. On create => what should be created? 

3. On delete => what should be deleted as well


JobOrder can't be confirmed if there is no sufficient spare part.  DONE


if there is job order created => update machine, update component, update compatibility , update asset 


job_order will need to be revised (the list of job order entries ) if these followings are updated:

1. Machine's component  ( DONE ) 
	=> on add or delete.. it can't delete if there is confirmed job order entry
	=> on addition, it has to find all job orders (unconfirmed), and create the corresponding component job
	 order entry 
	
	# what if there is no compatibility created yet? Too bad. can't update the job order entry. Hence,
		no job order confirmation.


2. Asset's machine (if there is job order, not allowed to change machine). If there is no job order,
		allow to change the machine. 
	
3. Component's compatibility. If there is job order using such particular item in the compatibility, 
   the compatibility can't be deleted.
